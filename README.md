# Networking and Persistence iOS demo

This is a sample project I developed during the April-June 2023 iOS Bootcamp from Kodeco. I extracted the code from my capstone project which is an e-commerce app.

In this article in my blog, I give a full explanation of the project: https://brunocamps.com/2023/06/14/networking-and-persistence-in-ios/

This project features a Product model that complies to the API from https://fakestoreapi.com/products

It has a NetworkingManager class that handles all our networking. There's also a FileManager extension that saves the payload from the api in a JSON file inside our app's directory.
